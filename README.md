## Features

- Link with the GNU C Library (glibc) because aligned to the System V ABI
- Everything is expression, that may returns value (stored in `rax` register)

## Goal

The **Rem** project aims to be useful programming language optimized for Linux computing.

Rem just **simplifies** C with expression-based syntax.
