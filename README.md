***Make C more easy to code!*** the low-layer programming language

> [!NOTE]
> Compile for x86_64 GNU/Linux only (tested on Debian)

## Features

- Link with the GNU C Library (glibc) because aligned to the System V ABI
- Everything is expression, that may returns value (stored in `rax` register)
- No type system! all-values are 64-bit binary, you can freely operate it

## Demo

For example, the "Counter App" written by Rem using GTK+3.0 running on GNOME desktop.

## Goal

The **Rem** project aims to be useful programming language optimized for GNU/Linux computing.

Rem **doesn't abstractify** C but Rem just **simplifies** it with expression-based syntax. 

> [!TIP]
> I'm considering entry to 2026 U-22 Programming Contest.
